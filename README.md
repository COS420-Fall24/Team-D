## Mission Statement:
StyleNest: Empowerment through everyday wear

## Problem Statements:
### Problem Statement 1:  
On average, women spend one year in their lifetime deciding what to wear. (Source). It would be helpful to have an app that could reduce the amount of time deciding what to wear. For example it takes an average of 16 minutes to choose an outfit every weekday morning. Having a tool to reduce the amount of time and stress used to choose an outfit would allow more time to sleep, do something in the morning, or pick up a hobby. How can we build an app that take your closet and creates outfits that you can wear and takes the weather into account?

### Problem Statement 2:  
People take too long choosing what to wear in the morning and are overwhelmed by decision fatigue. For example, when people are already stressed about their day, having to pick out pieces to plan an outfit is overwhelming and tedious. People may try to plan out their outfits the night before, but at night people are often exhausted and want to go to bed as soon as possible. Prior solutions try to address time efficiency, but fail to address decision fatigue and the steps involving an outfit. How can we design a convenient app to consider the weather, your wardrobe, and your preferences?
